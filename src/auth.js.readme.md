we havent directly copy paste code from appwrite docs just because following reasons

1) little bit garbage like code 
2) we have created class and inside it we have define all the methods like creation, login, getCurrentprofile.. whenever we want to use any methode we just have to create a object and access all the methods and properties
3) in future whenever you have to make any changes, then since everything is at one place, so you can efficiently make any changes
